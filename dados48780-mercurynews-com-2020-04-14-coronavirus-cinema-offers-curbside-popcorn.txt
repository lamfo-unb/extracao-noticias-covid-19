Are you a movie lover who is missing watching films the way they were intended to be seen, on a large screen in a dark theater?
Maya Cinemas feels your pain.
The California theater chain has come up with a way to improve the experience for customers who have been forced by the COVID-19 crisis to watch movies at home.
They’re popping the popcorn.
Every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, customers can purchase a 2-gallon resealable bag of freshly popped popcorn and two movie-size candies for $12.
It’s a contact-free, curbside pickup operation. You call in your order between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. for pickup from 2 to 5 p.m. No money changes hands; you pay over the phone. To maintain social distancing, pickup will be scheduled in 15-minute increments.
“This is a way for Maya to stay connected to its movie-going community,” spokesman Greg Heckmann said. “The first week of the program was incredibly well-received and orders were beyond all expectations.”
To order from Maya’s Bay Area location, in Pittsburg, phone 925-754-1164 for pickup at 4085 Century Blvd.
