Anthony works as a doorman in Harlem. The 27-year-old’s job used to keep him busy. Now, he’s bored — and lonely.
Today, I might have seen three tenants. I feel very sad. I enjoy the daily interactions with the tenants: making them laugh, greeting them as they walk into the building, petting the dogs as they pass by, seeing the big smiles on the kids’ faces when they pass through the lobby doors. I don’t get to be me.
We’re seeing more grocery deliveries. If my co-worker from the morning shift gets them, I have pretty much nothing to do except disinfect the whole lobby two, three, maybe four times a shift.
The doorman title is [considered] essential by the city. That’s an amazing feeling. It gives us a sense of accomplishment, that we’re here to protect and be more vigilant for the tenant.
