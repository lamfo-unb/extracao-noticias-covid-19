It’s time to take matters into your own hands. A week after New York City sent out a health announcement asking citizens to masturbate and avoid “rim jobs” during social isolation for the coronavirus, another crisis has hit our sexy times.
According to the Guardian, a global shortage of condoms is looming after the coronavirus lockdown forced the world’s biggest producer to shut down production.
Malaysia’s Karex Bhd, which makes one in every five condoms globally, has been shut down for a week as the Malaysian government imposes factory lockdowns to stop the spread of the pandemic.
The company, which is marketed in the States by Durex, was “given permission to restart production on Friday, but with only 50% of its workforce, under a special exemption for critical industries.”
“It will take time to jumpstart factories and we will struggle to keep up with demand at half capacity,” the chief executive, Goh Miah Kiat, told the paper.
“We are going to see a global shortage of condoms everywhere, which is going to be scary. My concern is that for a lot of humanitarian programs … in Africa, the shortage will not just be two weeks or a month. That shortage can run into months.”
