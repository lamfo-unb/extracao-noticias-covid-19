""I'm going to be doing an executive order today directing all Floridians to limit movements and all personal interactions outside the home to only those necessary to obtain or provide essential services or conduct essential activities,"" DeSantis said at a press briefing.
The order will take effect Thursday and will remain in place for 30 days.
As of Wednesday, there were nearly 7,000 coronavirus cases in the state, with the epicenter of the outbreak in South Florida.
DeSantis issued a ""safer-at-home"" order on Monday for Broward, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Monroe counties through the middle of May.
The governor faced intense criticism for refusing to issue a stay-at-home order for the entire state. DeSantis said on Tuesday that a White House recommendation to invoke such an order would “carry a lot of weight.""
“I’m in contact with them, and, basically, I’ve said, ‘Are you guys recommending this?’” DeSantis said at a press conference Tuesday, referring to the White House’s COVID-19 task force. “The task force has not recommended that to me. Obviously, if they do, that is something that would carry a lot of weight with me.”
