Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Sony Pictures announced Monday that it is postponing its big summer releases to 2021.
The studio announced it is rescheduling the releases of Jason Reitman's “Ghostbusters: Afterlife” and the Marvel movie “Morbius” to 2021 as theaters across the world remain closed while people avoid large gatherings to curtail the spread of COVID-19.
Hollywood's summer season — the film industry's most lucrative time of year — is increasingly shutting down because of the pandemic. In addition to theaters nationwide being closed, major film productions have halted with no clear timeline for resuming.
AIRLINES STEP UP CLEANING PROCEDURES IN RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK
“Ghostbuster: Afterlife,"" set 30 years after “Ghostbusters II,” had been scheduled for July 10, but it will now open March 5 next year. The Jared Leto-starring “Morbius,"" slated for July 31, will now be released March 19 next year. “Greyhound,” a World War II drama starring Tom Hanks, is now to-be-determined instead of opening on June 12.
'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' will be postponed until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
