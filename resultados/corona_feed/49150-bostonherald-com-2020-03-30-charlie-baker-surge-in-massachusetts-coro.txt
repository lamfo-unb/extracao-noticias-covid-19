Gov. Charlie Baker on Monday said the state anticipates the surge in coronavirus cases to hit Massachusetts “between the 7th and 17th,” of April.
“This isn’t an exact science but generally speaking most of the calculations that are out there with respect to Massachusetts – some of the ones we’ve done and some of the ones other people have done – suggest that the surge here is probably going to start somewhere between the 7th and the 17th,” Baker told reporters Monday.
Baker shared the forecast during his daily coronavirus response update delivered in Gardener Auditorium at the State House, where he also announced the state had requested, and received authorization for an additional 1,000 ventilators to be delivered to Massachusetts from federal resources.
