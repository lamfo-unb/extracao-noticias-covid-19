At a World Economic Forum dinner in Davos, Switzerland, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke up. It was 45 minutes into a conversation about climate change and trade, and no one had mentioned the most important issue facing the world, he said: The deadly new coronavirus spreading across China.
Mr. Mnuchin told dinner guests he worried the health crisis could undermine global growth. Earlier that day, Jan. 23, Chinese officials said they were cutting transport in and out of Wuhan, the epicenter of the public health crisis.
