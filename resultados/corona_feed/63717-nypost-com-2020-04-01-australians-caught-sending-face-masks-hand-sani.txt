Australians who export medical supplies such as face masks and hand sanitizer could now face up to five years in the slammer — a move intended to  keep the goods Down Under during the coronavirus pandemic.
The move, which was enacted this week by expanding existing customs regulations, has prohibited the exportation of gloves, gowns, goggles, visors and alcohol wipes, as well as masks and hand sanitizer, the Daily Telegraph reported.
Under the ban, the goods could be seized by customs officers and added to the national medical stockpile if they’re not defective, according to the report.
“These measures have become necessary because we have seen a small number of individuals engaging in the bulk purchasing of essential goods from retail outlets in Australia, with the intent of profiteering from exploitative exporting and price gouging,” Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said in a statement.
The ban comes after Chinese-backed company Greenland Australia came under fire for shipping hordes of supplies from Sydney to Shanghai, including 10,000 masks, 30,000 protective gowns and 68,000 disposable gloves, the outlet reported.
The company claimed that it shipped the good there in late February because China “at the time, was the epicenter of the outbreak,” the outlet reported.
