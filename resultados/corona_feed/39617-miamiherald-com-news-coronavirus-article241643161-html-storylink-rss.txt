Walmart announced it will be taking extra precautions as the novel coronavirus continues to spread — including checking employees’ temperatures before they start work, the company said.
On Tuesday, Walmart announced it would start checking the temperature of associates before they begin work at the company’s stores, clubs and facilities, according to a news release.
Employees will also be asked “basic health screen questions” before they start their shifts.
Walmart is sending infrared thermometers to all locations, which the company expects to take three weeks, according to the release.

Anyone with a temperature of at least 100 degrees will still be paid for reporting to work, but they will be asked to go home and pursue medical treatment if necessary, the release said. Those employees will have to be fever-free for at least three days before returning to work.
“Many associates have already been taking their own temperatures at home, and we’re asking them to continue that practice as we start doing it on-site,” the release said. “And we’ll continue to ask associates to look out for other symptoms of the virus (coughing, feeling achy, difficulty breathing) and never come to work when they don’t feel well.”
Walmart added it will also be making gloves and masks available for all associates who want to wear them, as supplies permit.
Masks — which Walmart describes as high quality but not N95 respirators — are expected to arrive at stores within two weeks, according to the release.
