The sheriff’s office received an anonymous tip on Friday that Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne, the Pentecostal pastor at the River at Tampa Bay Church in Riverview, refused to stop holding mass gatherings and instead was encouraging people to come to services.
Sheriff’s office personnel and legal staff spoke with the church’s legal team in an attempt to educate them about the orders they were violating on Friday and Sunday. Members of the sheriff’s office command staff also tried to meet to with Howard-Browne over the weekend but he did not make himself available.
“His reckless disregard for human life put hundreds of people in his congregation at risk and thousands of residents who may interact with them in danger,” Chronister said.
