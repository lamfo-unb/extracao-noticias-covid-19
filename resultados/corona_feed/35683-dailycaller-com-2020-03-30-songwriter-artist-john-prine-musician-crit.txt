“After a sudden onset of Covid-19 symptoms, John was hospitalized on Thursday (3/26),” the family shared Sunday on Twitter. “He was intubated Saturday evening, and continues to receive care, but his situation is critical.”
John Prine’s diagnosis came after his wife Fiona Whelan Prine revealed she had tested positive for COVID-19 on March 17. She noted she was quarantined from Prine, 73, and they were both in isolation at the time.
“This is hard news for us to share,” Prine’s family added in the latest statement. “But so many of you have loved and supported John over the years, we wanted to let you know, and give you the chance to send on more of that love and support now. And know that we love you, and that John loves you.” (RELATED: Country Music Icon Joe Diffie Dies At The Age Of 61 Due To Coronavirus Complications)
