The number of coronavirus cases in Massachusetts is expected to surge sometime in the middle of April, Gov. Charlie Baker said Monday.
“This isn’t an exact science, but generally speaking, most of the calculations that are out there with respect to Massachusetts – some of the ones we’ve done and some of the ones other people have done – suggest that the surge here is probably going to start somewhere between the 7th and the 17th,” Baker told reporters Monday.
Baker shared the forecast during his daily coronavirus response update delivered in Gardener Auditorium at the State House, where he also announced the state had requested, and received authorization for an additional 1,000 ventilators to be delivered to Massachusetts from federal resources.
The request for between 1,000 and 1,400 ventilators was processed in approximately 48 hours, Baker said, noting that the “quick turnaround” indicates a recognition from the federal government that, “we do in fact have a demand or a need,” for the equipment. Baker said he expects those to be delivered sometime between now and the first week in April.
“It’s a big, positive step forward in the right direction,” Baker said.
When asked about death projections in the state, Baker said, “a huge part of what we’re trying to do both through preparation around the surge and a lot of the other work that we’re doing is to make sure that everybody who can be saved, is saved. I prefer to think about it that way.”
