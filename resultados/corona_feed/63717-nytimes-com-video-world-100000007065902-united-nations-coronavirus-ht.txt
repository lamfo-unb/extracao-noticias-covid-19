"new video loaded: Coronavirus Pandemic ‘Is a Call to Action,’ U.N. Secretary General Says
transcript

And if we forget political games, and understand that it is humankind that is at stake. The message of the report we are reaching today is clear: Share the responsibility and global solidarity in response to the impacts of Covid-19. It is a call to action.
