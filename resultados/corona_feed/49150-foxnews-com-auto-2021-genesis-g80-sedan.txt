Hyundai and its luxury brand Genesis are offering to cover new buyers’ car payments for up to six months in the event they lose their job in the wake of the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.
Car shows may be getting canceled, but the parade of new models carries on.

Genesis was expected to debut its new 2021 G80 sedan adjacent to the now-postponed New York Auto Show in April, but has revealed it on the internet ahead of planned sales in the second half of this year.

The midsize four-door sports the same styling language as its recently-introduced GV80 SUV, with a shield-shaped grille and “Quad Lamp” split lighting clusters front and rear.

The interior features open-pore wood, leather trim, a 3D digital instrument cluster, 14.5-inch touchscreen display and overall dramatic styling aimed at competing with the likes of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5-Series. Front seats equipped with seven adjustable air bladders that provide a stretching function are among the available luxury options.
