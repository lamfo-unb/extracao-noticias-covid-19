People may call 800-504-7030 toll-free to be connected with legal service providers in their area. Legal assistance includes issues with bankruptcy, unemployment, medical claims, child custody, foreclosure, landlord-tenant problems and public benefits.
Individuals who qualify for assistance will be matched with Texas lawyers who can provide free legal help, though there are some limitations on the legal services available. The service is a partnership among the State Bar of Texas, the state's legal aid agencies, volunteer organizations and access-to-justice organizations.
Texas Legal Services Center also created a webpage of COVID-19 resources that people can access at texaslawhelp.org. The website includes information about eviction and tenants rights, forced quarantines, unemployment benefits and others."
