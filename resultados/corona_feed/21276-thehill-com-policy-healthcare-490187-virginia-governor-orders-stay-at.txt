"Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) issued a stay-at-home order Monday as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread.
Northam said people should only leave their homes to obtain food, supplies or medical care, or for exercise. All gatherings of more than 10 people are banned.
“I want to be clear: Do not go out unless you need to go out. This is very different than wanting to go out,” he said.
""This has been a suggestion to Virginians. Today it’s an order,"" he added.
Northam said the beaches and other recreational areas were “literally packed” this weekend and that people were putting themselves and others at risk.
He addressed those who gathered at these locations directly: ""You are being very, very selfish because you are putting all of us, especially our health care providers at risk.""
The announcement comes hours after Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) ordered similar restrictions, effective 8 p.m. Monday.
Northam's executive order closed Virginia's beaches to everything but exercising and fishing. Campgrounds have also been closed.
All higher education facilities were instructed to cease in-person classes.
Following his previous executive order, all restaurants and nonessential retail stores may continue to stay open if they limit the number of people in a space to 10 or less. Restaurants are only permitted to do delivery, takeout and pickup.
The governor said the goal is to reduce the expected medical surge in hospitals. Northam said the state currently has 18,500 beds, including 2,000 ICU beds.
As of Monday afternoon, Virginia has documented 1,020 confirmed cases of coronavirus, leading to 136 hospitalizations and 25 deaths. The state has tested 12,000 people.
