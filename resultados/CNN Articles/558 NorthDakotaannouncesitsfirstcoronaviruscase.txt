North Dakota has just announced the state's first case of coronavirus. The presumptive positive case is a resident in his 60s from Ward County, according to a news release from North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. The patient had traveled out of state, and had contact with another infected person, said the news release. He has not been hospitalized, and is now self-isolating at home.“We have been planning and preparing for this since January, and our top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of all North Dakotans,” Burgum said in the news release. “With the North Dakota Department of Health and its partners at the state, local and federal levels, we are working together to stay on top of this rapidly evolving situation."
