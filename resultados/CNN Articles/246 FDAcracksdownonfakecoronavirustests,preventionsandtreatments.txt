Article Title: FDA cracks down on fake coronavirus tests, preventions and treatments, Posted On: 03-20-20, At: https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-20-20-intl-hnk/index.html
The US Food and Drug Administration said Friday that it is closely watching the market and will take appropriate action against firms claiming to offer fraudulent coronavirus tests, preventions and treatments. The FDA said it is starting to see unauthorized home tests being marketed by some companies. The FDA has not authorized any home test, although the agency said it is working with test developers to create one. The FDA said it has already sent warning letters to companies that were selling and promoting coronavirus related items that were fakes. The agency said it is also stepping up enforcement at ports of entry, including at international mail facilities. In a separate investigation, US Customs and Border Protection services seized fake test kits at the Los Angeles International Airport on Saturday.“Fraudulent health claims, tests, and products can pose serious health risks,” the FDA statement said. “They may keep some patients from seeking care or delay necessary medical treatment.”
