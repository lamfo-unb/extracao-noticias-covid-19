Article Title: No deal reached tonight on coronavirus response package, Pelosi says, Posted On: 03-12-20, At: https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-12-20-intl-hnk/index.html
Top negotiators were unable to clinch a final agreement on a sweeping legislative package to address the economic fallout of the growing escalating coronavirus crisis tonight, pushing talks into Friday as they sought to close out a handful of outstanding issues. After hours of talks and trading of proposals, including eight separate phone calls over the course of the day between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin -- who is President Donald Trump’s point person on the talks -- negotiators are still attempting to iron out differences on specific language over a package that is expected to include paid leave, expanded food assistance, extended unemployment insurance and free coverage for coronavirus testing. “It’s fair to say we’re close to an agreement, subject to the exchange of paper, and hope to have an agreement tomorrow,” Pelosi told reporters outside of her office this evening. “We’ve resolved most of our differences and those we haven’t, we’ll continue the conversation because there will be other bills.” Asked if she was confident that there would be a vote on a deal on Friday, Pelosi responded: “One way or another.”
