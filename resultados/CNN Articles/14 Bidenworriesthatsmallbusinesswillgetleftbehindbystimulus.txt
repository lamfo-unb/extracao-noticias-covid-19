Article Title: Biden worries that small business will get left behind by stimulus , Posted On: 03-27-20, At: https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-27-20-intl-hnk/index.html
Joe Biden praised the $2 trillion stimulus package signed by President Donald Trump today, but worried that the largest emergency aid package in US history might not be enough to save the small businesses ravaged by the crisis.“Small businesses need help now. And so we have to make sure you're in a position to be able to get the kind of immediate aid that's available to you under this new legislation,” Biden said, adding that a lot of it would come down to Trump’s ability and desire to pull the right levers. “It's about management. How it gets out the door from the federal government and the White House.”Biden said the provision in the bill that blocks executives from buying back stock was a good step in assuring that those who need the help get it, but pushed for additional government action if banks don’t start pumping out capital.“We have to make sure the small business loans you get and/or the low-interest loans you get. They are in a position where we're going to say to the banks you got to get them out the door. As you know, they're not very good at getting out the door the small business loans,” Biden said. The former vice president also suggested that, should banks fail to recapitalize those businesses, the White House should consider finding some executive authority – “another version of the Defense Production Act” -- as a way, he said, to “keep the economy in better shape than anything else we're doing.” Watch:
