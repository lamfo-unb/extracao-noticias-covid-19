Article Title: Pence spoke with Michigan's governor on Saturday, Posted On: 03-28-20, At: https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-28-20-intl-hnk/index.html
In another sign of how Vice President Mike Pence is managing relationships with certain Democratic governors differently than President Trump, Pence spoke with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Saturday morning, per a tweet from her account.Whitmer, whom Trump has criticized for being insufficiently "appreciative" and "way in over her head" in recent days, posted on Twitter that she had a "good call with @VP this morning " and that the state of Michigan had just received a delivery of 112,000 additional N95 respirators.Some context: Trump on Friday said he had advised Pence not to call Whitmer or other governors who have been critical of the federal response."I tell him — I mean, I'm a different type of person — I say, 'Mike, don't call the governor of Washington. You're wasting your time with him. Don't call the woman in Michigan,'" Trump said during a Friday news conference."You know what I say? If they don't treat you right, I don't call," Trump said, before noting that Pence is "a different type of person" and will "call quietly anyway."CNN reached out to Pence’s office for comment.
