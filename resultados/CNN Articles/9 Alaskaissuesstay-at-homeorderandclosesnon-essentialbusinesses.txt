Streets were mostly desolate Saturday, March 21, 2020, in downtown Anchorage, Alaska.  Mark Thiessen/APAlaska is the latest US state to order residents to stay at home unless absolutely necessary due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.Limited outdoor activities are allowed as long as social distancing of 6 feet (1.8 meters) is maintained.In a pair of new mandates announced Friday evening, state Health and Social Services Commissioner Adam Crum said Alaskans are also ordered to avoid travel between communities.Travel to many rural areas of Alaska is only practical by plane, but Crum said aviation companies will not be required to ensure that their customers are traveling for essential reasons.The prohibition on unnecessary travel goes into effect Saturday at 8 a.m. local time, while the new rule on staying at home goes into effect at 5 p.m. Crum says the mandates will be reconsidered no later than April 11.
