It was originally scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9.Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Katie Ledecky joined CNN's ongoing town hall to talk about the postponement.It's "obviously disappointing, but it was certainly the right call," she said. "It doesn't really make sense to bring everyone from around the world together in the middle of a pandemic."The next steps forward will depend on the new dates for 2021, which will determine the scheduling for trials and training.For now, Ledecky is hunkering down and social distancing like everybody else. "I'm not doing anything besides staying in my apartment trying to stay in shape the best I can," she said.
