The US State Department raised the worldwide travel advisory to Level 3 on Wednesday night -- meaning citizens should reconsider travel abroad.“The Department of State advises US citizens to reconsider travel abroad due to the global impact of Covid-19. Many areas throughout the world are now experiencing Covid-19 outbreaks and taking action that may limit traveler mobility, including quarantines and border restrictions,” the statement said. “Even countries, jurisdictions, or areas where cases have not been reported may restrict travel without notice.”The note was released shortly after President Donald Trump’s address to the nation, announcing new travel restrictions from Europe.
