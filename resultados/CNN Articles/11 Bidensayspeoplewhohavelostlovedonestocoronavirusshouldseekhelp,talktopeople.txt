Former Vice President got visibly emotional Friday night when discussing how hard it is to not be there for loved ones dying from coronavirus.Biden referenced his personal history of losing his wife, children and parents."My message is, God love you. You know, I've lost a couple children, I've lost a wife and it is incredibly difficult to go through and it's harder to go through when you haven't had an opportunity to be with the person while they're dying. My mom, my dad I was able to be with them and lie in bed with them as they took their last breath. My son I was able to do that. My deceased wife I was not able to do that. I was not able to be there. And it makes a gigantic difference for people," Biden said during CNN's town hall.He continued: "And seek help. Seek help afterwards. Seek help, talk to people who have been through it so they know, they know they can tell you that you can get through it. You really can. It's possible. But, boy, it is so, so, so hard. That's one of the cruelest, cruelest things that's happening."Biden closed out the town hall by encouraging anyone struggling with loss to contact his campaign.Watch:
