The United Kingdom has advised its citizens on Monday “against all but essential travel to Italy, due to an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus,” according to a statement from Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). The advisory came after Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced at a news conference on Monday that the whole country of Italy is now on lockdown.“British nationals remain able to depart Italy without restriction,” the FCO said.“Airports remain open throughout Italy. However, airline schedules are subject to change and some flights are being cancelled,” the FCO added.
