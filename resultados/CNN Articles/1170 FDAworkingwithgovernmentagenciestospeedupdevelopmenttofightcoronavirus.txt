The US Food and Drug Administration is working with other government agencies to encourage the development of medical products that may diagnose, treat or fight the virus.There is no vaccine, treatment or commercially available product to even test for the virus. The FDA created a page on its website to keep the public up-to-date about any products in development in relation to the Wuhan coronavirus. It also put a call out to diagnostic test sponsors that may want to use the Emergency Use Authorization to get a product that could test for the virus into the market. The FDA is also working with public health agencies to share the reference materials that companies may need to create a test.We are actively leveraging the vast breadth of the FDA's expertise and have begun employing the full range of our public health authorities to facilitate the development and availability of investigational medical products to help address this urgent public health situation," said FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen M. Hahn.
