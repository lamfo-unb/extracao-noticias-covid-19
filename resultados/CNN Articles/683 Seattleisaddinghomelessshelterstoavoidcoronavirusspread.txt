Article Title: Seattle is adding homeless shelters to avoid coronavirus spread, Posted On: 03-05-20, At: https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-05-20-intl-hnk/index.html
The city of Seattle is working to add new homeless facilities in an attempt to slow the spread of novel coronavirus. Mayor Jenny Durkan announced that two new groups of “tiny houses” and a repurposed former treatment facility will make it possible for the city to house another 100 people without shelter.“Our neighbors experiencing homelessness are at greater risk of exposure to COVID-19, And as a City, region, and Country we must act with urgency to address the ongoing impacts of this public health crisis,” Durkan said in a statement. Remember: Currently, no novel coronavirus patients have been identified by health officials as being homeless.The shelter expansion follows efforts by King County to add new temporary buildings to isolate confirmed coronavirus patients, including three modular units and a motel. Durkan said Seattle’s new homeless facilities are not intended to serve people who already have the novel coronavirus.It will take up to three weeks before the new shelters are fully operational. Durkan said additional shelter options can be made available more quickly if necessary, using plans already in place for severe weather emergencies.
