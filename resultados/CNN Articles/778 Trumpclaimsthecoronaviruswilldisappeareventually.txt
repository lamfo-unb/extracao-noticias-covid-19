We’re going to continue," Trump said at an event with attendees of an African-American History Month reception in the Cabinet Room. "It’s going to disappear. One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear. And from our shores, you know, it could get worse before it gets better. Could maybe go away. We’ll see what happens. Nobody really knows."Trump called his Wednesday appearance before the White House press corps “a really good press conference.”“One of the advantages is that I get covered live,” he added. “It was a calming press conference.”He also claimed the media won’t give the administration “credit” for a successful response to the coronavirus.The President also said that the federal government was busy preparing for the coronavirus while Democrats were working on impeachment.“While they were working on impeachment, we were working on doing this. Because we were hearing about it,” he said.
