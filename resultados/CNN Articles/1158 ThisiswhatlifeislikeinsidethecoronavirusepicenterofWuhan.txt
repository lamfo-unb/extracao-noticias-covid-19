Courtesy Ben KavanaghToday is Ben Kavanagh’s birthday. The Irishman is teaching psychology in Wuhan and says he should be out at the local Irish bar in the city celebrating with friends. Tomorrow, he had planned on returning to Europe to do some traveling.He remembers first hearing about the coronavirus as “a disease similar to SARS” around December 31.“Sir, can I go, I’ve got SARS,” he remembers one student in his class saying as a joke.Now, he’s trying to pass the time with Netflix and keeping in touch with friends and family. Kavanagh is one of 11 million Wuhan residents who are under travel restrictions. They are now essentially quarantined inside the city limits.Kavanagh went to a nearby supermarket two days ago to get enough supplies: water, pasta, hot dogs, canned food, soy milk and other non-perishables.Except he’s run of out of face masks, which are essential in preventing him getting the coronavirus. “I never had enough to begin with and the stores ran out immediately,” Kavanagh says. He says stores have been trying to restock, but he won’t be going outside until absolutely necessary. Kavanagh says he doesn’t worry, most of the time.“When I'm going to sleep my mind wanders and worries,” he says. “I think about how there's 11 million people in the city and not even 1% of them are infected.”
