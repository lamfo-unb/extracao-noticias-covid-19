 Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesDefense Secretary Mark Esper has approved a request to provide military housing for up to 1,000 people who may need to be quarantined upon arrival in the US from overseas travel due to concerns about possible infection from the coronavirus, the Pentagon said in a statement today.The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) asked the Defense Department to provide several facilities capable of housing at least 250 people in individual rooms through Feb. 29, the Pentagon added."Under the request, DOD will only provide housing support, while HHS will be responsible for all care, transportation, and security of the evacuees. DOD personnel will not be directly in contact with the evacuees and evacuees will not have access to any base location other than their assigned housing. In accordance with CDC guidelines, all evacuees will be monitored for a period of 14 days. Should routine monitoring of the evacuees identify ill individuals, HHS has procedures in place to transport them to a local civilian hospital," the Pentagon said in the statement.The Pentagon says these installations have been selected by DOD to assist HHS evacuation operations, if needed:The 168th Regiment, Regional Training Institute, Fort Carson, ColoradoTravis Air Force Base, CaliforniaLackland Air Force Base, TexasMarine Corps Air Station Miramar, California
