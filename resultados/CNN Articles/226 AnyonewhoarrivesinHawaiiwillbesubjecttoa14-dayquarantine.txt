Anyone arriving in the state of Hawaii -- including returning residents -- will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.The mandate, which is the first of its kind in the United States, will go into effect Thursday at 12:01 a.m. and remain in place until further notice, the state's governor David Ige said.“We want this action to send a message to visitors and residents: we appreciate their love for Hawaii, at this time we believe our community is very, very important and we need to come together as a community to fight this virus,” he said at a press conference. Ige said that while the economy will suffer from this move, it was necessary. Violators could be subject to a $5,000 fine and a year imprisonment.
