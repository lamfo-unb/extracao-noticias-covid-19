Article Title: More than half of New Orleans' emergency medical workers are under quarantine, mayor says, Posted On: 03-24-20, At: https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-24-20-intl-hnk/index.html
More half of New Orleans' medical emergency services personnel is under quarantine due to the coronavirus pandemic, the city’s mayor told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Tuesday. With New Orleans hospitalizations expected to exceed their capacity in 11 days, according to the Louisiana Gov. John Bell Edwards, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said she is looking for the federal government’s major disaster declaration to get a long-awaited relief.“We're looking for that declaration to be approved so that it can unlock the much needed resources that our first responders need on the ground. For example, my EMS department, over 50% of my people are now on quarantine. And so while we've unlocked additional resources at the state level, the state can no longer go on without federal assistance at this time,” Cantrell said.There have been at least 375 cases of coronavirus and 26 deaths in New Orleans so far, the mayor said.
