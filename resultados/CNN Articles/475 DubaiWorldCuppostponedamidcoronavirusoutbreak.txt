                            The 25th running of the Dubai World Cup, one of the highlights of the racing calendar, has been postponed until next year amid the novel coronavirus outbreak.  Organizers had announced earlier this week that the event would go ahead without paid hospitality spectators on March 28, but took the decision Sunday to push it back until 2021.  With $35 million up for grabs across nine races, the Dubai World Cup is the world's richest race day which includes a $12 million purse for the showpiece Group 1 race.
