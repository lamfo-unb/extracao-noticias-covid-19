Steve Sisolak said only businesses and organizations that serve food, gas and other essential items or social services can remain open as of noon Wednesday. Restaurants can only provide their services via delivery or carryout.All casinos are ordered closed, as well as pubs and wineries that do not serve food. All gaming devices in any location must be shut down by midnight Tuesday night.“Non-essential services such as beauty shops, barber shops [and] salons should close until further notice,” Sisolak said. “This is not the time for sleepovers, play dates, theater outings, or athletic events... it's definitely not the time to go to the movies.”Sisolak strongly suggested postponing weddings scheduled for the next month – especially those involving guests traveling from out-of-state, and even advised Nevadans to limit attendance at funerals. The order does not apply to houses of worship, but the governor said, “I strongly urge our faith leaders to find ways to deliver to their congregations without bringing them together in person.”“It’s incumbent upon the citizens of this state to take this seriously,” Sisolak said as he pounded the podium with his finger.
