The ship currently has 219 people on board who have the virus, Ripley said. "What's most disturbing about that number is that they've tested fewer than 500 of the more than 3,500 people on the ship," Ripley said on Anderson Cooper Full Circle.According to the Japanese government, the reason why everyone hasn't been tested is because there are a limited number of testing kits and a limited way to test them, Ripley said.Ripley described the scene on the Diamond Princess, where passengers haven't had their rooms cleaned since the ship docked. He's heard of parents telling children that they must remain in their room because of "this invisible monster called the coronavirus that's outside.""[Families] are inside their cabins, they are waiting for the crew to deliver Crayons and arts and crafts supplies. They use their bunk beds as trampolines. They are trying to do anything they can to keep the kids happy and occupied," Ripley said.The first deadly case in Japan: Japan recorded its first death from the coronavirus,Â a woman in her 80s who was not on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
