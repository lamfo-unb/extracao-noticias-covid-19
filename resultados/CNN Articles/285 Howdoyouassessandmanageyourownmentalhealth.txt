Question: At CNN's coronavirus town hall Thursday, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta asked psychologist and author Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer about the best ways for people to manage and assess there own mental health, especially considering that for many, the pandemic is not a single traumatic even but rather a long period of significant change.Answer: Schmelzer likened the public's response to the coronavirus to the stages of grief, and encouraged people to find "coping strategies" to keep their stress levels down. "It's important that people allow themselves to cope the way they need to," she said. "This is essentially repeated trauma. This is going to go on for a while, and so people will adjust their behaviors. And they're going to have to unlearn some things when we come out of this."
