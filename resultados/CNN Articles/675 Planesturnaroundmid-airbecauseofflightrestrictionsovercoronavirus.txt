The company said on Saturday the cancellations were in response to local measures introduced by the Spanish government.

"We have taken the decision to cancel all flights to Mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands with immediate effect," a Jet2 spokesperson confirmed to CNN in a statement, asserting that the health and safety of customers is the airline's "number one" priority.
