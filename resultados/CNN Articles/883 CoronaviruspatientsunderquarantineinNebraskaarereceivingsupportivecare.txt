  Paul Vercammen/CNNThe 13 patients who arrived at the University of Nebraska Medical Center from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are receiving supportive care, Dr. Mark Rupp, chief of the hospital's Division of Infectious Diseases, told CNN.“They're in the chicken soup stage right now, so they're really just getting supportive care,” Rupp said.He also noted that while the mortality rate for the virus is being calculated at around 2%, he expects that number to eventually fall.“I won't be surprised when this is all said and done to see mortality rate somewhere in the neighborhood of maybe point five or 1% rather than over 2%,” Rupp said.
