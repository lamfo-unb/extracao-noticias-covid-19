Dr. Anthony Fauci CNNDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the risk of coronavirus in the US is "really very minimal because there really are only 15 cases now, in addition to those who were shipped here."In an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Monday, he went on to say the cases "were identified, they were isolated and the contacts were traced.”“Obviously, things could change. If this spreads more diffusely throughout the world, there’s the possibility we may actually have a global pandemic. So although I’m saying the risk right now is minimal in the United States and we should just go about our daily business, we need to keep an eye on it because it can change, and that’s the reason why we’re taking it very seriously,” Fauci said.He said the soonest a vaccine for the novel coronavirus could make it through the development process and clinical trials is “at least a year to a year and a half.”
