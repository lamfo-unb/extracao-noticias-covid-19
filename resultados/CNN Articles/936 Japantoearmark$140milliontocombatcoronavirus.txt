Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will approve a series of emergency measures to combat the coronavirus in a cabinet meeting on Friday, according to the prime minister’s office. The government will earmark 15.3 billion yen (approximately $140 million) for emergency measures, including ones to bolster testing and medical treatment capacity, to double mask production to more than 600 million a month, and credits for small and medium-sized businesses hurt by the outbreak, according to the prime minister’s office. The prime minister will also approve a measure calling for 1,800 beds to be readied for patients and for virus research results to be shared internationally.
