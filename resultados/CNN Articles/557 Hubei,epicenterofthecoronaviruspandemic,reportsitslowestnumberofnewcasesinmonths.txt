Xiao Yijiu/Xinhua via APMainland China reported 15 new coronavirus cases yesterday -- continuing the week-long trend of dramatically falling numbers, according to China's National Health Commission.Six of those cases were imported from overseas -- meaning they weren't locally transmitted in China.Hubei province, where the coronavirus pandemic began back in December, reported eight new cases -- the lowest to be reported from Hubei since the outbreak began.The drop in new daily cases is especially striking given that just a month or two ago, the country was reporting around 2,000 new cases per day.China has now reported 80,793 cases and 3,169 deaths. Of the total cases, 62,793 have recovered and been discharged from hospital, according to the NHC.
