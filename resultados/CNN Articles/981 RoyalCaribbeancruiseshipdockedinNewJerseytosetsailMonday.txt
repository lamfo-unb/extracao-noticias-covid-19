Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas cruise ship, which has been docked in Bayonne, New Jersey, since returning on Friday, will be able to set sail Monday, according to CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey. Bayonne is just south of Manhattan. Officials from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screened 27 passengers on the ship at the port, and four were taken to the hospital for further evaluation for coronavirus. None of the four showed "any clinical signs or symptoms of coronavirus" on board, Royal Caribbean said in a statement. One tested positive for the flu. Passengers began boarding the Anthem of the Seas on Sunday.
