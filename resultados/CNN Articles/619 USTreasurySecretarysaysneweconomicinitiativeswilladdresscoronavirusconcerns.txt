Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said oil market changes were a large component in the day’s earlier stock market decline.“Today was an unprecedented move in the oil markets. So we saw an overnight reaction of over down 20% and that’s obviously what had a major component today on the stock market,” Mnuchin said Monday at a White House press briefing.Mnuchin also said the US is moving into the economic bumpiness from a good place.“We couldn’t be more pleased that coming into the situation with the coronavirus the US has the most resilient economy in the world. I am in daily conversations with (Fed) Chair (Jerome) Powell. We are committed and we just had a meeting with the President and the economic team,” he said.Mnuchin described what new economic initiatives the President will propose tomorrow.“There are parts of the economy that are going to be impacted, especially workers that have to be at home … under quarantine or taking care of their family. We’ll be working on a program to address that. We will also be working with small businesses that need liquidity through SBA program. We’re looking at alternatives at the IRS. We have large tax payments coming up of providing certain relief to companies and individuals for liquidity,” he remarked.“This is not like the financial crisis, where we don’t know the end in sight. This is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months,” Mnuchin added.
