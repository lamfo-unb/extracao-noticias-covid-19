 AFP/Getty ImagesThe Pentagon confirmed Wednesday a Marine who works inside the building has tested positive for Covid-19. A defense official said the last time the Marine, an officer, was in the Pentagon was March 13. He began self-isolation on March 15. He works in the plans, policy and operations office of Marine Corps headquarters. This is the first military person based at the Pentagon to test positive.“A marine stationed at the Pentagon tested positive for Covid-19 on March 24. Per U.S. Centers for Disease Control guidelines, the Marine is in isolation at his home and will undergo further assessment by health professionals," the Marines said in a statement. "The Marine followed official guidance by isolating himself when his spouse began to show symptoms. Once he became ill, he contacted his assigned medical facility. His workspace has been cleaned by a Pentagon response team and a thorough contact investigation is underway to mitigate risk and preserve the health of our Marines, civilians, and families.”Separately, a staff who works in the Pentagon’s National Military Command Center is awaiting test results, a second defense official confirmed. It's not immediately clear when the person was last in the command center and what part of that complex they work in.  Defense One was first to report both cases.
