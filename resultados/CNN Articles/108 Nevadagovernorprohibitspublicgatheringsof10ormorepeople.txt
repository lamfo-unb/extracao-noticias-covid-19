 Steve Marcus/Las Vegas Sun/AP/FileA new emergency order from Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak prohibits people from gathering in groups of 10 or more due to the coronavirus pandemic. “Social distancing is our number one defense to defeat this virus,” Sisolak said in a Tuesday evening press conference.The order does not apply to private homes or essential services. It comes as Sisolak says the state is still struggling to determine how many people have been affected by Covid-19. "Nevada has submitted four requests for Covid-19 testing components,” the governor said. “We have received zero shipments for Covid-19 testing components.”
