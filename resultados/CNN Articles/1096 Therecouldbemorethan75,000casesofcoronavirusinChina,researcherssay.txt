Article Title: There could be more than 75,000 cases of coronavirus in China, researchers say , Posted On: 01-31-20, At: https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-01-31-20-intl-hnk/index.html
An estimated 75,815 people in Wuhan, China could be infected with the novel coronavirus as of January 25, researchers in Hong Kong said. Gabriel Leung, one of the authors of study published Friday in the medical journal The Lancet, said the estimates could be much higher than the number of confirmed cases because "not everyone who is infected would require or seek medical attention."Leung, who is the chairman of public health medicine at the University of Hong Kong, and the other authors cautioned "that given the lack of a robust and detailed timeline of records of suspected, probable, andÂ confirmed cases and close contacts, the true size of the epidemic and its pandemic potential remains unclear."Passengers were wearing protective masks at Beijing Capital Airport in Beijing, China on Thursday.
