 Greg Bowker/Getty ImagesNew Zealand has recorded a 30% jump in coronavirus cases as the country heads into lockdown by the end of day Wednesday, according to Ashley Bloomfield, the country's Director of Health.There are 47 new confirmed cases and three new probable cases, bringing the Pacific nation's count up to 205, Bloomfield said at a news conference on Wednesday.What is a probable case? New Zealand is including probable cases in its national count going forward, which includes people who present with coronavirus symptoms and have exposure history despite a negative test.Bloomfield said the government will continue to see a rise for the next 10 days before a turnaround.“The numbers will continue to increase before they turn around,” he said. “That turnaround will happen if all New Zealanders do what is asked of them -- that is to stay at home, break the chain and save lives.”
