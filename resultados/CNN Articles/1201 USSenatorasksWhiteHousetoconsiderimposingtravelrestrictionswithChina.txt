 Jose Luis Magana/APUS Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has asked the Trump administration "when and how" it will restrict travel between the US and China, in light of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, in a letter sent to several Administration officials.The letter, dated January 24, was sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and heads of Department of Health & Human Services, Department of Transportation and Department of Homeland Security.The letter reads in part: "I appreciate that CDC has already initiated screening for the virus at major airports and would urge you to expand this program as aggressively as possible. I also appreciate that CDC has issued a travel advisory for the region. However, I believe Americans deserve advance notice of your plans to evaluate more aggressive limitations on travel between the U.S. and China and of any additional considerations that might lead you to refrain from such measures."Hawley asks for a response to his letter within a week.
