There was a need for targeting testing, he said.He said he was encouraged by the spirit of collaboration and offers of help from Tim Cook and Elon Musk. Housing issues: Housing the homeless in hotel rooms and trailers is a priority, he said. His office has identified 1,000 additional nursing facility beds that could be readied for the senior community.
