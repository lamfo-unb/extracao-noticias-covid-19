 J. Scott Applewhite/AP/FILEThe White House has requested $1.25 billion in emergency funding to address coronavirus, as well as the ability to tap an additional $535 million in emergency funds already appropriated. This letter, obtained by CNN, was sent to the Hill just a short time ago.The Trump administration expects “to allocate at least $2.5 billion in total resources” for the response effort. Much of that would come from shifting already appropriated money from agency accounts.
