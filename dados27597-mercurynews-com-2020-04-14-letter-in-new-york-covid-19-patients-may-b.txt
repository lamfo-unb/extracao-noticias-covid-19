In this time of pandemic, we live in strange times.
In San Francisco, the homeless are moved from tents or a “navigation center” to hotel rooms.
In New York, patients sick with the COVID-19 may be moved from their rooms into tents, while patients not sick with the virus are moved from hospital rooms to a real navigation center — a U.S. Navy ship.
Meanwhile, many national and state parks are closed so no one can get away from all this and camp out in a tent, not even the homeless.
